Project Instructions: 
Create a sinatra application that uses mongoid to access mongodb. Create a class representing a "shirt" that has the following fields:
- color (string)
- witty_saying (string)
- size (integer)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime) - use Time.now upon an edit action, otherwise defaults to nil
 When a Shirt is created, it should also have timestamps automatically appended to the document indicating when it was created and last updated.

Create a simple form that will allow me to create a Shirt, POST it through sinatra into mongodb and return a JSON representation of the Shirt to be displayed (in plain text) after submitting the form.

Create a 'search' route in sinatra that allows me to pass in a query string to return expected results from mongodb. The results should be an array of JSON objects.
Example: /search?color=red&size=2

Bonus: (not required, but fun/interesting...this took me a while to figure out)
Augment the search functionality to allow a mechanism to do searches like "size > 2". Only need ">", "<", ">=" and "<=" functionality. (Hint: You can only use the equal sign on query string key-value pairs, so it has to be by some other method...still on the query string, though.)
